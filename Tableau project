#  Airbnb – Tableau Dashboard

## Project Objective
Create a beginner-friendly yet portfolio-ready **Tableau dashboard** using the Seattle Airbnb dataset to help a prospective host decide **where** to buy, **when** to list, and **what** property size (bedrooms) could maximize returns.

---

## Dataset Used
- **Source:** Seattle Airbnb Open Data (listings, calendar, reviews)  
- **Working file:** 
<a href="https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/">Dataset</a>

## Key Questions (KPIs)
- **Which ZIP codes** command the highest **average nightly price**?
- **Where are those ZIPs on a map** (spatial context)?
- **When do prices peak** across the year (weekly seasonality)?
- **How does average price vary by bedrooms**?
- **How crowded is each bedroom segment** (distinct listing count by bedrooms)?

**Interactive Dashboard:**

- Tableau Public (optional): <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aditya.pujari4885/viz/AirBNBFullProject_17615898455710/Dashboard1?publish=yes">View Dashboard</a>

## Process

### Data Preparation & Joins (Tableau Data Source)
- Imported Excel with 3 sheets: **Listings**, **Calendar**, **Reviews**.
- Set relationships/joins:
  - `Listings.id` **=** `Calendar.listing_id` (**Inner Join**)  
  - `Listings.id` **=** `Reviews.listing_id` (**Inner Join**, **optional**)  
- Note: Tableau Public caps at **15M rows**. If you exceed the limit, **exclude Reviews** (used only for demo joins) and/or **filter Calendar to Year = 2016**.

### Cleaning & Typing
- Converted **bedrooms** to a **dimension** (categorical axis) when needed.
- Used **Average** for price aggregations; **Distinct Count** for listings.
- Excluded **NULL/0-bedroom** rows in bedroom visuals.
- Ensured consistent **ZIP code** usage across bar and map for aligned colors.

### Dashboard Assembly
- New **Dashboard (Automatic size)** → placed sheets in a 2×3 layout:
  - Top: Price by ZIP (left) + ZIP Map (right)
  - Middle: Weekly Trend (full width)
  - Bottom: Avg Price by Bedrooms (left) + Listings by Bedrooms (right)
- Enabled relevant legends, tidy titles, and applied a simple color theme.

## Insights (from this build)
- **High-priced ZIPs** cluster in specific neighborhoods (see map for quick context).  
- **Seasonality:** Prices dip in **Jan–Feb**, peak in **summer** and **holidays**.  
- **Bedrooms:** 5–6 bedroom properties show meaningfully **higher avg nightly price**, while **1-bedroom** dominates **supply** (more competition).
